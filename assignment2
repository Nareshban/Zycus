Write a bash/python script that takes list of hostnames (comma separated) as an argument.

This script, when executed, should connect to all the servers via. SSH (standard port) (assume password-less connectivity) and give a single prompt to the user.

When the user executes a command on this prompt, the script should run the command on all connected servers and display the output.

Ans:

#!/bin/ksh
ARG_LIST=$1
for i in `echo $ARG_LIST | tr ',' ' '`
do
   ssh  $i -n "echo $i"
done

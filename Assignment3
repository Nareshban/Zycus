Assignment 3:



Consider a monolithic java application stack.

Apache Web Server, Apache Tomcat application server with Active MQ and Oracle and MongoDB backend.

Propose a solution to migrate this application stack to AWS. Mention all the AWS services you would use and how you would maintain HA and Load Balancing (consider app to be stateless). Mention rationale for each design decision.

Ans:
1.route 53 apache tomcat with SQS , oracle on RDS and DynamoDB
2.route 53 in case  Apache web server - usually it is used for load balancing and expose to external web
3.Apache Tomcat is middleware / web container - it is will same for java deploymen
4.SQS in case of ActiveMQ - for asynchronous message communication
5.Oracle on RDS or any other RDBS on RDS in case of in house oracle - RDS will reduce 
  the  administration of DB and snapshot and backs can be enabled and high availability with multi AZ 
6.DynamDB in case  MongoDb - both are nosql Dbs but with DynamoDb can scale up to unlimited and administration 
  work will reduced and High Availablity with MultAZ or cross region replication
